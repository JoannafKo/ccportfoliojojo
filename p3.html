        Description
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      This is an artistic interpretation of a clock through the seasons. The top half is the warm seasons, represented by suns and greenery, while the bottom half are the cold seasons, represented by leaves and snowflakes. Each circle represents an increment of time, ordered from smallest to largest. The most inner circle being seconds, while the most outer circle being years.

        Design Process
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      At the start, I was thinking more literally about a clock, conceptually. So I designed a calender, an hourglass, and metronome.
    </p>
    
      
    
    <p>
     
      I found it difficult to translate these images into the sketch, and I wanted to be more interpretive, so I ditched all the sketches and went with something entirely different. Something that was related to seasons. I first created four images that represented the four seasons in photoshop, and then uploaded them onto the sketch, so that they can be used for the drawing machine. I used the if / else statements to create the brushes, as well as make sure each side was divided by the specific seasons. The time functions were used to create the rings, to represent the yearly time, especially with the outer ring. It was difficult for me to rotate the circles, even though I followed the instructions, so I decided to just to make an aesthetic decision, and add the instructions in the middle.

        Reflection
      </h1>
    
    <p>
      This project was slightly easier, but it was more consuming and took me longer to finish. Overall, this experience has just taught me to outreach for more information and tutorials, because it can be specifically useful for your intentions and decisions. Additionally, it made me more comfortable with being more creative. ALso, this project reaffirms my preference for drawing images for the projects instead of using the shape functions. It is much easier to do so, and fits my aesthetic better.
