        This camera captures the image in circles. However, the trick is sliding the cursor across the screen, which allows the circles to shrink or grow in size. I did this so show the juxtaposition of the realistic and detailed, to the abstract and simplified. I was also inspired by an engineer named Daniel Rozin, a man who makes mirror installations that can mechanically mimic the movement of the subject, usually made out of bizarre objects such as copper or toys.

        I first had to test the waters out with three experimental sketches, two of them were the webcam and face capture I did in class, and the instagram filter that was given as an example. Inspired by the instagram filter, I ended up doing more research, and decided to do something shape related. I had difficulties however. p5.js got a lot more laggy when using the webcams, it got so bad that I had to restart the computer just to get that one site working again. So yeah, despite being a fresh breath of air after last week's project, it still wasn't easy

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        This project was a little more fun and relaxing. I actually found the process of creating webcams with javascript and experimenting with them to be fascinating, I just wish the internet didn't lag because of it. If there is a solution, I would be glad to hear. This project also appealed to my artistic sensibilities, in which shapes to simplified in order to literally reflect reality.
