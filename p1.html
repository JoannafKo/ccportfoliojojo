        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        I was partnered up with Maya Rodic, and her lost object was a blanket her parents gave her. It was size 14’’x14’’, colored pink, and split into quads. The squares of made up of the colors pink and white, the same colors being placed diagonally to one another. Each square was decorated with two lines, with the contrasting color. The white lines on the pink squares were placed vertically, while the pink lines on the white squares were placed horizontally. The center of the blankethad a teddy bear in a pink outline. Finally, the entire blanketwas decorated with a border colored in a darker pink.

        Design Process

      <p>
        I first made the background pink  entirely. Then I made three extra squares on top of the background, two of them being white, while the third one being colored pink. I then worked one by one on each square, to add two lines. On pink squares, I created white vertical lines, placed them near horizontal edge. On the white squares, I created pink horizontal lines, placed near the vertical edge. For the teddy bear, I created one circle for the head, and one wide ellipse for the torso. Two vertical ellipses were used for the legs, while two horizontal ones were used for the arms. Two circles were then added for the head. Maya was not specific about the bear's features, aside from the pink borders which I added, so I gave the bear a triangle pink nose. After that was completed, I added four lines in the border of the blanket, colored in hot pink.

        I was anxious about coding the object. Maya's description, while simplistic and straight to the point, had a lot of description and points in it. So if felt like I had a lot to do. She also was vague about where each detail was compositioned in her object. The only thing she said anything about composition was that the teddy bear was in the center. So a lot of the what I was going to put in the editor was up to me. Since this is my first time, I decide to go with a more simplistic look, so that I don't overcomplicate myself. It was difficult to understand things like the coordinates and commands at first, but I was able to work through it thanks to muscle memory and experimination. I ended up creating something very simplistic and cutesey, with a limited pallet of white, pink, and hot pink. Something that anyone would give to their baby.
