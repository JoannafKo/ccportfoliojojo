        The personal habit I was trying to track was my drawing hobby. It was October, which means that were was going to be a high concentration of drawing challenges, which I am already partaking in. I decided, for the data, to keep track of the different brushes and colors I was using for my art. The viewer just needs to click on the image, so that it can randomly generate a sample of the brush and color recorded at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I just simply had to draw my projects to collect the data. I used a spreedsheet, which I placed down below, to record every time I used a different brush and color. I did this to keep a record, so that I can go back and create samples of said brushes and colors. Column A was the name of the brush, while column B contained the HEX code of the colors. A total of 20 data points were made.

      </div>
      
      <p>
        Once the data collecting was finished, I went back to photoshop. I created 20 600 by 600 pixels artboards, and made the brush samples with their corresponding colors. I then exported and uploaded the files onto javascript. My intentions for this project was to have a sample randomly generate whenever you click on it. I first created an array, called currentRandomBrush, with the images inside of them. I then used a user-definded function, called drawBrush, for the images to allow the images to appear. I did this for the sake of brevity, and to easily have the images in one place. I put that user-defined function in the draw function. I then created a mouse pressed function, and made sure it had the array in it, and that it could randomly generate the images. And that was it

        Reflection
      </h1>
      
      <p>
        The one thing that I learned about myself is that a merger between personal passions and schoolwork can work at times. Thus far I have drawn all my assets, but this project brought drawing to the forefront and the theme. It just reaffirmed my belief that drawing images for javascript is the most fun method of visualization for me. That's what I gained, just reaffirmation.
