    <P>
      This project was incredibly hurried. Mainly because some of the participants of the team did not send their corpses on time. So I literally had to finish this project the day before. I decided that my best approach is to be as simplistic as possible. First for the corpse itself, I took three body parts of the images below, and combined and entirely redrew the corpse. I even animated a gif the corpse to have it bowing, and added it into the p5 js sketch. I utilized the call & define and parameters & arguments functions to create the background. By creating a circles that moved up to down, in a contrasting pace. From left to right, each corpse was made by Chuwei Zheng (legs and arms), Yue Huang (torso), Congrui Liu, and me (head).

      Backstory
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      This poor little chimera, who is cat across her upper body, but bird throughout her torso and legs, is lonely. She finds no solace among the cats, and finds no companionship among the birds. Which is inevitable, cosnidering this chimera IS a human experiment with no say in her own life... until now.

      Reflection

    <p>
     This project has been both harder and easier. Easier because there were less functions to incorporate. But it was hard because of having to wait for other teammates to send their corpses in time. Because of that, much of the work was pushed at the last minute, which created more crunchtime and hurry. Which, if memory serves correctly, was why I had to usemy own corpse for the project instead of the third teammate's. This also made me somewhat grateful that the functions were more simple for this project.
