        Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
        This was the hardest project I had to do so far. I think it was the one I can honestly say was emotionally draining. This game's concept from fights going on within my personal life. So I vented much of my frustration and anger into making this game. I took the feedback to use less photoshop and rely more on coding itself. The only digital assets used were audio and sprite images. I struggled most with the format of the game. It was incredibly difficult for me to do the platform game, which I intended to do, so I switched over to a space invader type game. Which, I found to be more fitting of the game's themes at the time. I chose animals to symbolize the family members, not for any artistic reason, but so that I could get my assignment past the radar of my parents. So that they don't get pissed at me and nag me to change my game. Although the choices in animals are intentional. The girl is a bear, because the ears made her looking visually endearing. The siblings are bunnies because rabbits are infamous for large breeding numbers. The father is also a rabbit, but is quite drooping and weak looking. And the mother is a bear because of the motif of the mama bear. I also hid the health points on purpose to heighten the suspense. I did encounter errors along the way, like the rows of bunnies glitching and teleporting all over the place. However, I decided to use that in favor of the game, adding to the suspense and unpredictability. Overall, this game was venting grounds for personal issues going on, I poured out most of my frustrations against a lot of things and competitiveness.
